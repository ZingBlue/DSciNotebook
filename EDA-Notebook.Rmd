## Introduction

This Notebook aims to replicate some of the graphical results found in the [How do people feel about AI?](https://github.com/AdaLovelaceInstitute/how-do-people-feel-about-ai) report by the [Ada Lovelace Institute](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/).

The Ada Lovelace Institute survey is a database of survey results taken between November and December 2022 about the attitudes
towards various use cases of Artificial Intelligence.

Here's a brief summary of the data set:
```{r}
library(readr)
ai_survey1 <- read_csv("how-do-people-feel-about-ai-main/262400371_Public Attitudes to AI Raw Data NA (1).csv")
# Prep data
# Remove ppt identifying as 'other' and remove 16 year old 
#ai_survey1 <- ai_survey1 %>%
#  filter(is.na(RS_Sex) | RS_Sex != 3) %>%
#  filter(CS_Age != "16")
summary(ai_survey1)
```
