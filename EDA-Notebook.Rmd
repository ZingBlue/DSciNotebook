## Introduction

This Notebook aims to replicate some of the graphical results found in the [How do people feel about AI?](https://github.com/AdaLovelaceInstitute/how-do-people-feel-about-ai) report by the [Ada Lovelace Institute](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/).

The Ada Lovelace Institute survey is a database of survey results taken between November and December 2022 about the attitudes
towards various use cases of Artificial Intelligence.

Here's a brief summary of the data set:
```{r}
